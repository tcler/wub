This is the Wub base - it contains useful packages for
 implementing a pure tcl HTTP1.1 server.

Configuring Wub.
===============

The server will read configuration when the [Site init] or [Site start] commands are invoked.

Configuration dicts are applied in the following order:

1) hard-coded sensible defaults invisible to the application.

2) args to [Site init] or [Site start] are interpreted as configuration dict

3) ::$argv is interrogated for a value for the home configuration variable

4) .ini files as specified by $ini configuration variable are read from the $home directory (which defaults to the Site.tcl directory, but can be passed in as above) and interpreted as configuration.

5) the file $home/vars.tcl (if any) is sourced into the ::Site namespace - any variable definitions there override configuration variables.

6) ::$argv is interpreted as a configuration dict, so command-line variables override everything preceding.
