= File Domain =

The file domain maps a URL suffix to a file system path.

File domain correctly interacts with Cache domain, and does not itself interpret content
 (except directories, which it presents by generating HTML.)

File domain looks for an exact match, and will search around for a near-match by using a glob
pattern.  It also excludes certain files, matching the -hide regexp parameter.
