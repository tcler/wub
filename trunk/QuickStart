Dependencies:

  Must have tcllib (see http://wiki.tcl.tk/1246)
  Optionally:
	tls (http://wiki.tcl.tk/2630) - for SSL

Step 1:  Download the code (which you've probably done already)
     svn checkout http://wub.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ wub

Step 2: Change into the Wub directory:
     cd wub/Wub/

Step 3: configure the site.ini (optional, the defaults are sensible)
     cp example.ini site.ini
     # edit to your taste

Step 4: Run the demo application:

     tclsh8.6 Application.tcl

Step 5: For later

     customise the nubs: look in wub/Domains/nubs/ create a nub file to suit.
     quick and dirty: local.tcl in Application directory is always sourced before startup.
