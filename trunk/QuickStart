Dependencies:

  Must have tcllib (see http://wiki.tcl.tk/1246)
  Optionally:
	tls (http://wiki.tcl.tk/2630) - for SSL

Step 1:  Download the code (which you've probably done already)

     svn checkout http://wub.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ wub

     Alternatively: download and run http://wub.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Install.tcl in a clean directory which will become your Wub home directory.  Install.tcl will download the latest version of Wub, and install it in the directory from which it is run.

Step 2: Change into the Wub directory:
     cd wub/Wub/

Step 3: configure the site.config
     cp example.config site.config
     # edit to your taste, or just leave it as is

Step 4: Run the demo application:

     tclsh8.6 Application.tcl

Step 5: For later

     customise the site.config
